Each filename represents the size of the corresponding instance. The names are in the format n_d_s, where n is the number of vertices, d is the density of the graph, and s is the seed used by the algorithm that is responsible for creating the instances.

Each instance is an eulerian graph. The numbers n (number of vertices) and m (number of edges) are in the first line, in this order. The vertices are labeled from 0 to n-1. Following the first line, there are m lines, each line contains two number u and v that indicate the edge (u,v).
