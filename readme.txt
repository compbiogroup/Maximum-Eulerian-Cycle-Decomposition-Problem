Each filename represents the size of the corresponding instance. The names are in the format n_d_s, where n is the number of vertices, d is the density of the graph, and s is the seed used by the algorithm that created these instances.

Each instance is an eulerian graph. There are two numbers n (number of vertices) and m (number of edges) in the first line. The vertices are labeled from 0 to n-1. The following m lines contain two numbers u and v each, which indicates the existence of an edge (u,v).
